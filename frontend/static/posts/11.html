                        <li>SYN scans, while, as mentioned, are considered more stealthy, they're sometimes more prone to being detected by IDS/IPS systems, or network admins (For example, what's more suspicious when monitoring network traffic - a connection that gets destroyed mid-way through being established, or one of many hundreds or thousands of TCP/IP connections?).</li>

The server then responds by sending an RST packet (which closes the connection). With these scans, it is usually more difficult to determine whether the connection was first established from inside or outside the network, making them harder to detect by firewalls. Because of this, while with a SYN or Connect scan, a port may be designated as filtered, with an ACK scan, it might be shown as unfiltered.</span>
