The IDS seems to be very rudimentary and we are only required to get the OS (note: NOT the version of the OS). There are a few things to mention first, notably, the types of TCP scans we'll be running:</span>

During a SYN scan, we send a SYN packet to the server, and get returned a two packets: SYN and ACK. Once received, nmap tears down the connection and moves on to the next port.</span>

                        <li>SYN scans are fast, since we do not actually establish a full connection to the server.</li>

                        <b>Weaknesses:</b><br><br> 
                        <li>SYN scans require sudo privileges, because a SYN scan requires raw socket access.</li> 
                        <li>SYN scans, while, as mentioned, are considered more stealthy, they're sometimes more prone to being detected by IDS/IPS systems, or network admins (For example, what's more suspicious when monitoring network traffic - a connection that gets destroyed mid-way through being established, or one of many hundreds or thousands of TCP/IP connections?).</li>

                    <br><span data-i18n-key="htb_nmap_6th">Let's move on to Connect scans. These are far simpler - they establish a full TCP connection. A SYN packet is sent, SYN+ACK is received, and then the ACK packet is returned to the server, establishing a TCP connection. Only then is it stopped.</span>

                        <li>Slower, since a full TCP connection gets established. Can be mediated by increasing timing(-T) or the minimum rate(--min-rate).</li> 
                        <li>Generally 'louder' and more noticeable, especially on less active networks.</li>

                    <br><span data-i18n-key="htb_nmap_9th">Finally, we have ACK scans. Instead of sending a SYN packet as with the two previous scan types, an ACK packet is sent to the server. The server then responds by sending an RST packet (which closes the connection). With these scans, it is usually more difficult to determine whether the connection was first established from inside or outside the network, making them harder to detect by firewalls. Because of this, while with a SYN or Connect scan, a port may be designated as filtered, with an ACK scan, it might be shown as unfiltered.</span>
