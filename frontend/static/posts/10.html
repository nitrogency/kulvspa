This leads to better latency. Examples of it's use consist of large database queries (to fill an HTML table, for example) or when transmitting large images.</span>

It can split the usually blacklisted SQL keywords between chunks, which can make the request containing them be accepted. For example, the 'SQLMap' tool contains a tamper script utilizing this technique, using the '--chunked' parameter.</span>
